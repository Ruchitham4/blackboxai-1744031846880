# Healthcare Queue Management System

## Project Overview
The **Healthcare Queue Management System** is a web application designed to streamline the management of healthcare claims and patient interactions. This system allows various roles, including administrators, claims agents, and patients, to easily navigate, contribute to, and monitor the status of their claims efficiently. It utilizes local storage to manage session data, providing a simplistic yet effective interface for users to log in and view their respective workflows.

## Installation
To run this project locally, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd healthcare-queue
   ```

2. **Open the project in your browser**:
   Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser. Alternatively, you can use a local server (like Live Server in Visual Studio Code) for better performance.

## Usage
1. Upon opening the application, you will see the login screen.
2. Enter your username, password, and role to log in. The system includes predefined users for testing:
   - Admin: username: `admin`, password: `admin123`
   - Claims Agent: username: `agent1`, password: `agent123`
   - Patient: username: `patient1`, password: `patient123`
3. Based on the user role, you will be directed to either the queue dashboard or the patient view.

In the **queue dashboard**:
- Add new claims, update statuses, and manage existing claims.

In the **patient view**:
- View claims related to your name and see their statuses.

## Features
- User login with role-based access.
- Local data storage for claims and user management.
- Ability to add, edit, delete, and update claims.
- Status updates for claims, with visual indicators for priorities and statuses.
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS for a user-friendly interface.

## Dependencies
This project uses the following external libraries:
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons.

These are linked in the HTML files and do not require installation through npm or any package manager.
